<h2><a href="#">Yala National Park</a></h2>

<p>Located in the southern province, bordering the Indian Ocean, 
Yala National Park is the second-largest and most visited of all 
national parks in Sri Lanka. Known for its rich wildlife diversity,
 a jeep safari at the park will almost certainly guarantee you spottings 
 of crocodiles, elephants, water buffalo, spotted deer, monkeys, and leopards.
 In addition to wildlife diversity, Yala National Park also has 
 diverse landscapes – scrubs, light forest, grassy plains, and salty lagoons.</p>
 
<h2><a href="#">Minneriya National Park</a></h2>

<p>North Central Province of Sri Lanka, which was previously a wildlife sanctuary, 
was designated as the Minneriya National Park. This park is reported to host the largest 
known wild Asian elephant gathering in one location. Over 200 elephants have been spotted 
around the water reservoir during their feeding and bathing times, along with flocks of 
beautiful birds such as painted storks, herons, cormorants, and large pelicans. Scrub, 
forests, and wetlands are what you will be driving through on your game drive at the 
Minneriya National Park.</p>

<h2><a href="#">Udawalawe National Park</a></h2>

<p>Udawalawe National Park is one of the best places to see wild Sri Lankan elephants in action. 
Soaring highlands frames its northern boundary while grasslands and bush forests make up the 
rest of the landscape here. Located on the borders of Sabaragamuwa and Uva provinces, 
Udawalawe National Park is a couple of hours drive from Yala National Park, and is also one of the 
best places for game spotting. In addition to elephants, buffalos, crocodiles, spotted deer 
and peacocks, the park also boasts 184 varieties of birds including endemic varieties such as the junglefowl, 
spurfowl, grey hornbill, green pigeon, wood shrike and swallow.</p>

<h2><a href="#">Wilpattu National Park</a></h2>

<p>Along the northwest coast of Sri Lanka, the Wilpattu National Park gets its name because of 
its unique feature – natural sand-rimmed water basins that fill up with rainwater, also known as “Willus”. 
This national park is the oldest and largest of its kind in Sri Lanka and is abundant with dense forestations. 
The park is relatively uncrowded in comparison to the above two, which means that the unspoiled seclusion makes 
it ideal for those looking for a peaceful safari experience.</p>
 
<h2><a href="#">Sinharaja Rainforest Reserve</a></h2>

<p>A biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka – internationally recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Sri Lanka, 
the Sinharaja Rainforest Reserve should be on your Sri Lanka tour itinerary if you are a nature and animal lover.
Recognized as a living heritage, this tropical rainforest is home to 50% of Sri Lanka’s endemic wildlife and boasts 
a high diversity of vegetation. Drawing thousands of visitors, this ecosystem boasts the co-existence of birds, 
mammals, reptiles, insects, fish, amphibians, and plant-life! Mammals include the Rusty Spotted Cat, 
Barking Deer, Jackal, Purple-faced Langur, Macaque, and reddish-brown monkeys.</p> 

<h2><a href="#">Horton Plains National Park</a></h2>

<p>Located within the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka – which is a UNESCO World Heritage site, a visit to 
Horton Plains National Park is an experience similar to the African Savannah. Rich in biodiversity and 
endemic species, this park features a world that is completely different from the other national 
parks in the country. Three major rivers: Mahaweli, Kelani, and Walawe begin from here. 
The plateau that covers the trail at Horton Plains comprises of rocky outcrops, thick forests, 
wild grasslands, networked waterfalls, and misty lakes.</p>
